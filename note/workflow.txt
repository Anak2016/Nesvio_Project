Action:add subCategory by click submit 

categories.blade.php click activate js
-> create.js sends ajax request with Post
-> admin_routes.php select routes
-> SubCategoryController::store send JSON-encode('success')

=============================================================
problem: post wrong field name/id to be verify

product name = Product's price
product price = N/A
product category = category_id
product subcategory = sub_category_id 


possible cause: 
>name or id in view is wrong (checking)
>create.js extract wrong value
>Classes/Request::old is not correct
