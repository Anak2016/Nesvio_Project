submit with form
>Json file will use name of input block as key which hold its value
	:view(click submit button) -> route(post) -> Controller (here submit to database)

ProductCategory submit edit modal (submit with javascript)
>using ajax to send request, data need to be converted into Json file first before request is sent to target url
	>using ajax is more flexible because you select data to be sent (selected data must be inbetween the form). (with the cost of manually parse data to JSON)
	>using axios.js(with vue.js), data will automatically convert to json file. (an advantage over ajax)

	:clikc submit edit modal -> js (admin.update) -> send JSON file to url-> route(post) -> ProductCategoryController::edit 

axios vs ajax:
	>both can be used in subtitution. 
	>axios build on top of ajax.
	>axios and ajax is doing the same thing, but axios is better.

vue.js 
	>reduce amount of dubplicate code.
	>it allow html block to choose what method to be used while valina js must specify html block then apply functionality (its bad when 2 html block use the same code (duplicate code))
